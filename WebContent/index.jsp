<H2 class="subpagetitle"><b>Global Data Collection</b></H2>
Global Data Collection aggregates data from thousands of sources to provide superior breadth and depth of business information - creating the world's largest and most comprehensive business information database. D&B's database is the definitive source of identification and verification on over 140 million businesses from more than 190 countries. Our global database includes domestic and international companies, large publicly traded companies to small privately held businesses as well sole proprietorships. 

D&B has up to 1500 data elements on any given business, depending on the information available for that company. These data elements range from the obvious company name and address; to not so obvious Proof of Right, industry profile, NAICS codes, SIC codes, financial statements, small business indicator, commercial credit score, financial stress score, geocode, domestic and global linkage, payment experiences, and any special news and events. 

<H2 class="subpagetitle"><b>D-U-N-S Number</b></H2>
<p></p>The D-U-N-S Number is D&B's unique, nine-digit, location-specific business identification number, which D&B assigns as a means of identifying and tracking companies globally throughout their lifecycle. Once assigned, a D-U-N-S Number is neither reused nor assigned to another business. Used by the world's most influential standards-setting organizations, the D-U-N-S Number is recognized, recommended and/or required by more than 50 global, industry and trade associations, including the U.N, the European Commission and the U.S. Federal Government, where it is used by the General Services Administration, U.S. Postal Service, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Education, among others. 

<H2 class="subpagetitle"><b>Corporate Linkage</b></H2>
<p></p>Corporate Linkage uses the D-U-N-S Number to link members to their corporate families. Corporate linkage occurs in the D&B global database when one business location has a financial and legal responsibility for another business location. There are two types of corporate relationships in our database - branch to headquarter linkage or subsidiaries to parent linkage. Corporate Linkage enables D&B customers to view their total risk or opportunity across related businesses. D&B's global business database has more corporate family structures than any other data provider worldwide, with over 2.5 million families and 11 million family members. There is no limit to the breadth or depth of a corporate family. To better understand all the corporate linkage vocabulary - parent companies, parent headquarters, branch locations, domestic ultimate, global ultimate - check out Corporate Linkage PDF below.
